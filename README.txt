This presentation template is unique in that it uses the standard KOMA-Script scrartcl class to create a beautiful presentation. The use of a standard class means that this template allows direct copy/pasting from other LaTeX documents and doesnâ€™t require specialized commands like other presentation classes. The design of the slides is focused on readability with large fonts and line spacing. Each slide features a running head and a footer with information about the author as well as progress through the presentation. The coloring, shadows and custom fonts give the presentation an elegant look while clearly displaying any type of content. The template has examples of: including paragraphs of text, using multiple columns per slide, coloring text, bullet points, numbered lists, verbatim text, a table, a figure, a theorem, citations and reference lists.
